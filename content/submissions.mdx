Astrolabe is **closed for submissions** while we prepare to launch.

<Break />

Astrolabe is about *explorations in all dimensions*. Into the woods. Across a line. Beneath the ocean. Along a seam.
Into the branches of an alternate present or the crevasse of an alternate future. Across the rifts between one another. 

We’re interested in work that explores&mdash;sometimes moving beyond realism&mdash;in form or content or spirit.

Read [about *Astrolabe*](/about) for details on our mission and what we're doing with the Universe.

We ask for first North American serial rights and non-exclusive print/anthology rights. All copyrights remain yours.

- We consider only **unpublished work**.
- We currently accept three types of work: **fiction, creative nonfiction, and photography/art**. See below for
  genre-specific instructions. We don’t consider poetry.
- **We do accept simultaneous submissions**, but please let us know if your work was accepted for publication
  elsewhere—we’ll be thrilled for your good news!
- **No multiple submissions**—and if we don’t accept your work, please wait until our next submission period before
  trying again.
- **No reprints**, please!

## Fiction & creative nonfiction

Send us **one** piece of up to 3,500 words in `.doc`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` format.

## Photography &amp; art

Send us up to **five** pieces in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf` format. 

If your artwork doesn’t work in one of those formats—for example, if you’ve built something dynamic or interactive—send
a link to where we can view it online, or just ask!

## Time to submit!

Send submissions to [editors@astrolabe.ooo](mailto:editors@astrolabe.ooo).

Please format the subject line like so: *Submission: Your Name, “Title”*

Include a short cover letter, bio, and your work as an attachment(s). No need to send us your physical address or phone
number.

We’ll get back to you within **4 weeks**—if we take longer, feel free to [query us](mailto:editors@astrolabe.ooo).

## Your rights

Astrolabe asks for **first North American serial rights** (FNASR) to your work, which ensures that we’re the first place
this work appears. Once your work is published on Astrolabe, all electronic and print rights revert back to you—you can
republish the piece as you see fit. We also ask for **non-exclusive anthology and print rights**. This allows us to use
your work in a possible future anthology, but doesn’t prevent you from pursuing other anthology or print opportunities
in the meantime.

The copyright to your work remains yours at all times.
