## Contribute to *Astrolabe*

I'd happily welcome any code contributions to this magazine, whether they're bugfixes, enhancements to the Universe, or
other NextJS wizardry. I'm a novice in all aspects of JavaScript development, so I'm certain there are many, many places
to improve how the magazine functions.
