Astrolabe will open for submissions on the **winter solstice, December 21, 2022**, to celebrate the Universe as it materializes for the first time.

<Break />

At _Astrolabe_, we&rsquo;re looking for work that explores how we seek out, discover, and grasp onto connection. Into
the woods. Across a line. Beneath the ocean. Along a seam. Into the branches of an alternate present or the crevasse of
an alternate future. Across the rifts between one another.

And then, once we find one other, the myths we make.

We&rsquo;re excited to see as many interpretations of this broad theme as there are stars in the night sky.

We&rsquo;re open to work of all genres, with a particular fondness for anything that moves beyond realism in form or
content or spirit.

Read [about *Astrolabe*](/about) for details on our mission and what we&rsquo;re doing with the Universe.

<Break />

Our open submission periods will always be free. 

After the first open submission period ends, we&rsquo;ll introduce a year-round submission category, which will let you
submit to *Astrolabe* when we&rsquo;re closed to free submissions, for a $5 fee. We&rsquo;ll use these fees to pay
contributors and defer costs.

Some additional details:

- We pay a **$50 honorarium** upon publication.
- We currently accept three types of work: **fiction, creative nonfiction, and photography &amp; art**. See below for
  genre-specific instructions. We&rsquo;re not a poetry market at the moment.
- **We do accept simultaneous submissions**, but please let us know if your work was accepted for publication
  elsewhere—we&rsquo;ll be thrilled for your good news!
- **No multiple submissions**—and if we don&rsquo;t accept your work, please wait until our next submission period
  before trying again.
- We consider only **unpublished work**.

We ask for first North American serial rights and non-exclusive print/anthology rights. All copyrights remain yours.
Read more about the [rights we ask for](#your-rights).

## Fiction & creative nonfiction

Send us **one** piece of up to 3,500 words in `.doc`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` format.

## Photography &amp; art

Send us **up to five** pieces in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf` format. 

If your artwork doesn&rsquo;t work in one of those formats—for example, if you&rsquo;ve built something dynamic or
interactive—send a link to where we can view it online, or just ask!

## Time to submit!

Send submissions to [editors@astrolabe.ooo](mailto:editors@astrolabe.ooo).

Please format the subject line like so: *Submission: Your Name, "Title"*

Include a short cover letter, bio, and your work as an attachment(s). No need to send us your physical address or phone
number.

We&rsquo;ll get back to you within **4 weeks**—if we take longer, feel free to [query us](mailto:editors@astrolabe.ooo).

Track your submissions on [Duotrope](https://duotrope.com/listing/35081/astrolabe)!

## Your rights

Astrolabe asks for **first North American serial rights** (FNASR) to your work, which ensures that we&rsquo;re the first
place this work appears. Once your work is published on Astrolabe, all electronic and print rights revert back to
you—you can republish the piece as you see fit. We also ask for **non-exclusive anthology and print rights**. This
allows us to use your work in a possible future anthology, but doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from pursuing other anthology
or print opportunities in the meantime.

The copyright to your work remains yours at all times.
