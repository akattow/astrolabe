title: About

We’re exploring. Instead of publishing sequential issues or a stream of work that relegates what came before to the
background, we’re interested in perpetually connecting and recombining the work we publish and the artists who make it.
Letting the shape of their creations, however seeming-distant in genre or style or intent, tell a larger story together.
We’re envisioning a Universe that’s expansive & dynamic, inclusive & lush, a perpetual explosion that defies temporal
systems of organization or measurement.

A flat plane. An empty sky.

We want you to explore, too. We welcome you to stumble your way through the Universe in search of the unexpected. And we
hope that when you find something you love, you feel drawn to explore the asterism it belongs to, the other stars in its
vicinity, the potential meanings of colors and shapes. We hope you’ll look into the voids in this ever-changing Universe
and dream up what might, someday, call that place a home.

Be forewarned: things will keep changing. <span className="text-fuchsia-600 font-bold italic">The Universe isn’t a fixed
entity.</span>

We hope that’s exactly what will keep you coming back.

We’re never done exploring.
